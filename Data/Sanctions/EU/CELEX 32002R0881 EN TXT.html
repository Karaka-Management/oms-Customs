 certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons
and entities associated with Usama bin Laden, the Al-Qaida network and
the Taliban, and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 467/2001
prohibiting the export of certain goods and services to Afghanistan,
strengthening the flight ban and extending the freeze of funds and other
 financial resources in respect of the Taliban of Afghanistan</p><p></p><p>THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p><p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 60, 301 and 308 thereof,</p><p>Having
 regard to Common Position 2002/402/CFSP concerning restrictive measures
 against Usama bin Laden, members of the Al-Qaida organisation and the
Taliban and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities
associated with them and repealing Common Positions 96/746/CFSP,
1999/727/CFSP, 2001/154/CFSP and 2001/771/CFSP(1),</p><p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(2),</p><p>Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(3),</p><p>Whereas:</p><p>(1)
 On 16 January 2002, the Security Council of the United Nations adopted
Resolution 1390(2002) determining that the Taliban had failed to respond
 to its demands made in a number of previous resolutions and condemning
the Taliban for allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for terrorist
training and activities and also condemning the Al-Qaida network and
other associated terrorist groups for their terrorist acts and
destruction of property.</p><p>(2) The Security Council decided, inter
alia, that the flight ban and certain export restrictions imposed on
Afghanistan further to its Resolutions 1267(1999) and 1333(2000) should
be repealed and that the scope of the freezing of funds and the
prohibition on funds being made available, which were imposed further to
 these Resolutions, should be adjusted. It also decided that a
prohibition on providing the Taliban and the Al-Qaida organisation with
certain services related to military activities should be applied. In
accordance with paragraph 3 of Resolution 1390(2002), those measures
will be reviewed by the Security Council 12 months after adoption of the
 resolution and at the end of this period the Security Council will
either allow the measures to continue or decide to improve them.</p><p>(3)
 In this regard, the Security Council recalled the obligation to
implement in full its Resolution 1373(2001) with regard to any member of
 the Taliban and the Al-Qaida organisation, but also with regard to
those who are associated with them and have participated in the
financing, planning, facilitation, preparation or perpetration of
terrorist acts.</p><p>(4) These measures fall under the scope of the
Treaty and, therefore, notably with a view to avoiding distortion of
competition, Community legislation is necessary to implement the
relevant decisions of the Security Council as far as the territory of
the Community is concerned. For the purpose of this Regulation, the
territory of the Community is deemed to encompass the territories of the
 Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions
laid down in that Treaty.</p><p>(5) In order to create maximum legal
certainty within the Community, the names and other relevant data with
regard to natural or legal persons, groups or entities whose funds
should be frozen further to a designation by the UN authorities, should
be made publicly known and a procedure should be established within the
Community to amend these lists.</p><p>(6) The competent authorities of
the Member States should, where necessary, be empowered to ensure
compliance with the provisions of this Regulation.</p><p>(7) UN Security
 Council Resolution 1267(1999) provides that the relevant UN Sanctions
Committee may grant exemptions from the freezing of funds on grounds of
humanitarian need. Therefore, provision needs to be made to render such
exemptions applicable throughout the Community.</p><p>(8) For reasons of
 expediency, the Commission should be empowered to amend the Annexes to
this Regulation on the basis of pertinent notification or information by
 the UN Security Council, the relevant UN Sanctions Committee and Member
 States, as appropriate.</p><p>(9) The Commission and Member States
should inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and
 of other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this
 Regulation, and cooperate with the relevant UN Sanctions Committee, in
particular by supplying it with information.</p><p>(10) Member States
should lay down rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of the
provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented.
Those sanctions must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p><p>(11)
 Taking into account that the freezing of funds is to be adjusted, it is
 necessary to ensure that sanctions for breaches of this Regulation can
be imposed as of the date of entry into force of this Regulation.</p><p>(12)
 In view of the measures imposed under Resolution 1390(2002) it is
necessary to adjust the measures imposed in the Community by repealing
Council Regulation (EC) No 467/2001(4) and adopting a new Regulation,</p><p>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p><p></p><p>Article 1</p><p>For the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:</p><p>1.
 "funds" means financial assets and economic benefits of every kind,
including but not limited to cash, cheques, claims on money, drafts,
money orders and other payment instruments; deposits with financial
institutions or other entities, balances on accounts, debts and debt
obligations; publicly and privately traded securities and debt
instruments, including stocks and shares, certificates presenting
securities, bonds, notes, warrants, debentures, derivatives contracts;
interest, dividends or other income on or value accruing from or
generated by assets; credit, right of set-off, guarantees, performance
bonds or other financial commitments; letters of credit, bills of
lading, bills of sale; documents evidencing an interest in funds or
financial resources, and any other instrument of export-financing;</p><p>2.
 "economic resources" means assets of every kind, whether tangible or
intangible, movable or immovable, which are not funds but can be used to
 obtain funds, goods or services;</p><p>3. "freezing of funds" means
preventing any move, transfer, alteration, use of or dealing with funds
in any way that would result in any change in their volume, amount,
location, ownership, possession, character, destination or other change
that would enable the use of the funds, including portfolio management;</p><p>4.
 "freezing of economic resources" means preventing their use to obtain
funds, goods or services in any way, including, but not limited to, by
selling, hiring or mortgaging them.</p><p></p><p>Article 2</p><p>1. All
funds and economic resources belonging to, or owned or held by, a
natural or legal person, group or entity designated by the Sanctions
Committee and listed in Annex I shall be frozen.</p><p>2. No funds shall
 be made available, directly or indirectly, to, or for the benefit of, a
 natural or legal person, group or entity designated by the Sanctions
Committee and listed in Annex I.</p><p>3. No economic resources shall be
 made available, directly or indirectly, to, or for the benefit of, a
natural or legal person, group or entity designated by the Sanctions
Committee and listed in Annex I, so as to enable that person, group or
entity to obtain funds, goods or services.</p><p></p><p>Article 3</p><p>Without
 prejudice to the powers of Member States in the exercise of their
public authority, it shall be prohibited to grant, sell, supply or
transfer, directly or indirectly, technical advice, assistance or
training related to military activities, including in particular
training and assistance related to the manufacture, maintenance and use
of arms and related materiel of all types, to any natural or legal
person, group or entity designated by the Sanctions Committee and listed
 in Annex I.</p><p></p><p>Article 4</p><p>1. The participation,
knowingly and intentionally, in activities, the object or effect of
which is, directly or indirectly, to circumvent Article 2 or to promote
the transactions referred to in Article 3, shall be prohibited.</p><p>2.
 Any information that the provisions of this Regulation are being, or
have been, circumvented shall be notified to the competent authorities
of the Member States and, directly or through these competent
authorities, to the Commission.</p><p></p><p>Article 5</p><p>1. Without
prejudice to the applicable rules concerning reporting, confidentiality
and professional secrecy and to the provisions of Article 284 of the
Treaty, natural and legal persons, entities and bodies shall:</p><p>(a)
provide immediately any information which would facilitate compliance
with this Regulation, such as accounts and amounts frozen in accordance
with Article 2, to the competent authorities of the Member States listed
 in Annex II where they are resident or located, and, directly or
through these competent authorities, to the Commission.</p><p>In
particular, available information in respect of funds, financial assets
or economic resources owned or controlled by persons designated by the
Sanctions Committee and listed in Annex 1 during the period of six
months before the entry into force of this Regulation shall be provided;</p><p>(b) cooperate with the competent authorities listed in Annex II in any verification of this information.</p><p>2.
 Any information provided or received in accordance with this Article
shall be used only for the purposes for which it was provided or
received.</p><p>3. Any additional information directly received by the
Commission shall be made available to the competent authorities of the
Member States concerned.</p><p></p><p>Article 6</p><p>The freezing of
funds, other financial assets and economic resources, in good faith that
 such action is in accordance with this Regulation, shall not involve
the natural or legal person, group or entity implementing it, or its
directors or employees, in liability of any kind unless it is proved
that the freezing was due to negligence.</p><p></p><p>Article 7</p><p>1. The Commission shall be empowered to:</p><p>-
 amend or supplement Annex I on the basis of determinations made by
either the United Nations Security Council or the Sanctions Committee,
and</p><p>- amend Annex II on the basis of information supplied by Member States.</p><p>2.
 Without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Member States
under the Charter of the United Nations, the Commission shall maintain
all necessary contacts with the Sanctions Committee for the purpose of
the effective implementation of this Regulation.</p><p></p><p>Article 8</p><p>The
 Commission and the Member States shall immediately inform each other of
 the measures taken under this Regulation and shall supply each other
with relevant information at their disposal in connection with this
Regulation, in particular information received in accordance with
Article 5 and in respect of violation and enforcement problems and
judgements handed down by national courts.</p><p></p><p>Article 9</p><p>This
 Regulation shall apply notwithstanding any rights conferred or
obligations imposed by any international agreement signed or any
contract entered into or any licence or permit granted before the entry
into force of this Regulation.</p><p></p><p>Article 10</p><p>1. Each
Member State shall determine the sanctions to be imposed where the
provisions of this Regulation are infringed. Such sanctions shall be
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p><p>2. Pending the adoption,
where necessary, of any legislation to this end, the sanctions to be
imposed where the provisions of this Regulation are infringed, shall be
those determined by the Member States in accordance with Article 13 of
Regulation (EC) No 467/2001.</p><p>3. Each Member State shall be
responsible for bringing proceedings against any natural or legal
person, group or entity under its jurisdiction, in cases of violation of
 any of the prohibitions laid down in this Regulation by any such
person, group or entity.</p><p></p><p>Article 11</p><p>This Regulation shall apply</p><p>- within the territory of the Community, including its airspace,</p><p>- on board any aircraft or any vessel under the jurisdiction of a Member State,</p><p>- to any person elsewhere who is a national of a Member State,</p><p>- to any legal person, group or entity which is incorporated or constituted under the law of a Member State,</p><p>- to any legal person, group or entity doing business within the Community.</p><p></p><p>Article 12</p><p>Regulation (EC) No 467/2001 is hereby repealed.</p><p></p><p>Article 13</p><p>This
 Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its
publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p><p></p><p>This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p><p>Done at Brussels, 27 May 2002.</p><p></p><p>For the Council</p><p>The President</p><p>M.
